# Mini Project 2 - Determining the Polarity of Tweets

All the files are required to run the full code. And as for now, I have not uploaded my CNN Model saved as a .h5 file because it is 45MB, and I could not upload a file more than 25 MB. I am making improvements to these codes, so this is not the final code. Clone this repo or download it and run using 

python mainpage.py 

Git LFS is not working properly, so instead of uploading the model through that, I have shared a Google Drive Link to download the CNN Model, so kindly download it to run Meme Sentiment Analysis.

If you read MemeTest.ipynb, you'll see that this file will generate the .h5 file. But DO NOT attempt to run it as it won't work for you. The Dataset to train the CNN Model is with me and so you won't be able to run MemeTest.ipynb So download the .h5 file from the link.

server.py can be hosted on a Cloud or a Server to send Requests to the code. It will return a Response. It uses Flask to work as a Server. server.py is the Server code for the android application.
