# Mini-Project-2
All the files are required to run the full code. And as for now, I have not uploaded my CNN Model saved as a .h5 file because it is 45MB, and I could not upload a file more than 25 MB. I am making improvements to these codes, so this is not the final code. Clone this repo or download it and run using python mainpage.py . I have shared a Google Drive Link to download the CNN Model, so kindly download it to run Meme Sentiment Analysis.
